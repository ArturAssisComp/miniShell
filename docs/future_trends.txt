Topics and new features to explore in the future:
    [] - Implement alias feature. This feature should be implemented as a routine 
         executed before the lexical analysis. It basically searches for matches of 
         strings and exchanges those strings with other strings specified by the alias.conf file.
         Ex.:
         ls -> "ls --color=auto"
         "abc def" -> ghi

    [] - Add command history feature. This feature should be added before lexical analysis.
         The raw command is simply saved into the file command_history.log;
