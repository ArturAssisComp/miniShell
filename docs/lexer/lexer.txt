Version 1.0 [15/11/2021]
Lexer description:

The lexer will process the input from the user to recognize each token and 
to make it easier for the parser to check if the input is grammatically correct. 
This lexer will be built upon a regular expression recognizer implemented as a 
finite automaton.  The tokens will be saved into a data structure that will be 
built to be read later by the parser. What will be recognized as a token 
by the language? The miniShell language is very simple and is based on Unix Bash. 
Each command is followed by arguments and by input/output redirectors. In addition 
to commands, there will be reserved words that will be recognized as RESERVED_WORDS. 
It will be possible to redirect the input and outputs of the commands using special
symbols. In addition, it will be possible to use pipes, that will be represented as
special symbols too.
The lexer will recognize the following tokens: 
	Tokens that carry semantic value:
		- RES_WORD -> Token that represents reserved words. They represent 
                              special words that have special meaning for the miniShell; 
		- ID       -> Tokens for identification that are not RES_WORD. They must 
                              satisfy the following regular expression: [0-9, aA-zZ, -, /, _, .]+ 
                              The slash will be recognized as a valid ID character 
                              to accept paths as arguments. There will be a 
                              special situation in which quotes are used to create IDs 
                              with blank spaces (only ' '. Tabs are not accepted) inside. 
                              In that case, the regular expression is: 
                 ["][0-9, aA-zZ, -, /, _, ., ' ']*[0-9, aA-zZ, -, /, _, .][0-9, aA-zZ, -, /, _, ., ' ']*["];

	Tokens that do not carry semantic value:
		- IN_REDIRECT     -> Input stream redirection. It is the symbol '<';
		- OUT_REDIRECT    -> Output stream redirection. It is the symbol '>';
		- PIPE            -> Symbol that represents a Unix-like pipe. It automatically 
                                     redirects the output of the element before 
                                     the pipe to the element after the pipe. The symbol is '|'.
		- BACKGROUNG_EXEC -> If used at the end of the command, it makes the parent 
                                     process not calling wait. The process executes in the 
                                     background while the shell remains free to be used. The symbol is '&';
		- NEW_LINE        -> Used to represent the command in more than one line. 
                                     Makes it easier to write big commands. The symbol that 
                                     represents this token is '\'. 
		- EOF             -> Represents the end of the command. It is the last token.
		

Lexer design:

	- Token: The token will be implemented as a datastructure with two fields. One field
                 for the type of the token and the other for the semantic value of the token.

	- Lexer: the lexer will be implemented as a function that receives the input as a string
                 and returns a struct with an array with the tokens in the same order that they
                 were read, and with the number of tokens in the array (the size of the array).
