miniShell version 1.0

12/01/2022

    The command processor is the component of the miniShell that receives as 
input the structured commands from the parser and tries to execute them. The 
pipelines are executed from the first to the last. The command processor will 
check if there is any configuration file that defines the order in which the 
processor must follow to search for each command id. If there is no configuration 
file, the order is: built-in, executable (full path). The content of
the configuration files that will be used by the command_processor is loaded
to memory usually before executing each list of pipelines.

    Command search order configuration file: in order to configure the file 
command_search_order.conf, the user must add the desired paths in the following 
order: top-down. The processor will search for the command from the top until the 
bottom of the file. Each path in a single line. The possible paths are:  
<full_path> -> The id is treated as full path;
<rel_path>  -> The id is treated as relative path to the cwd (it is concatenated 
               after cwd);
<built_in>  -> The id is treated as built-in command;
<path:(path for the directory)> -> The id is treated as relative path to
                                   (path for the directory);
    Comments start with "//" and end with '\n'. They are ignored.
Ex. 1:
<path:/abc/def> //Path 1
<full_path>
<path:/ghi>     //Path 2

Ex. 2: 
<built_in>   //First, search for built-in commands.
<full_path>  //Second, search for full path commands.
//If the id was not found, the command is not executed.
