The user interface is responsible to prompt the commands from user. It stores the 
command line history, and manages calls the other components and procedures to 
execute the commands from user. After reading a line from user, it saves it in 
command history, calls the lexer, the parser, and tries to execute the command. 
It also calls procedures to initiate the variables of the shell.
